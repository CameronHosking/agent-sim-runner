If you intend to run this totally unattended just double click run_experiments.bat
After it is completed, open run_experiments.bat and replace %USERNAME%0 with %USERNAME%1 and run it again.
Repeat as many times as you want with increasing numbers after %USERNAME%.

If you intend to also use your computer read the comments in run_experiments.bat and remove -nogui so you can pause when you want to.
If you run with GUI enabled please don't select anything in the output right click menu.

If you want to mess with the simulator do it in test.bat
